# Polifactual

Polifactual is a web application that informs users on their local, state, and national legislative representatives. 

By taking a users address and zipcode, our application can pull in information from the Google Civic Information API to display local, state, and national reps information for the user. National(of course) will be the same for every user.

## Future Edits

Adjust footer links/content
- Currently several links in the footer do not redirect to another page. Due to time constraints we have decided to adjst the links after demo day

Comment portions of code that need more clarification and clean up files
  - Several componenets found in the code are class components, when in fact they could be fucntional components.
  - Several imports in files are not used
